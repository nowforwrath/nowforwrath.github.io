In either case, remove the Marker after rolling. On a 1-2, the model is slain and removed as a casualty -remove the Marker from the board. Whilst the Nazgul of Dol Guldur are in range of the Necromancer's Master of the Nazgul special rule (depending on how many Will Points he has remaining), the Necromancer can spend his Will Points to improve this roll. For each Will Point the Necromancer spends in this way, improve the Unholy\nResurrection roll by 1.\nWhilst the Marker is in play, this model counts as on the board for the purpose of determining whether your Army is Broken or reduced to 25%. However, a Marker cannot hold Objectives and the model will still count as being slain for the purpose of any special rules that come into effect when model is slain, such as a Heroic Combat.\nIf this model is slain by a Magical Power or an Elven weapon then they suffer a -1 penalty to their rolls for this special rule When the game ends, any Markers on the board are removed and the models associated with them count as a casualty"
