				"definition": "A model who carries the One Ring is referred to as the Ringbearer.\nWEARING THE RING\nA Ringbearer can put on the One Ring at any point during their Activation. As soon as they do they benefit from the Invisible special rule (see page 127). A Ringbearer who is unable to Activate (such as if they are Engaged in Combat) cannot put on the Ring.\nIf a model puts on the Ring whilst they are mounted, then their Mount will immediately bolt and flee the battlefield (the Mount is therefore removed), and the model must immediately take a Thrown Rider Test.\nSAURON'S WILL\nIf a Ringbearer begins its Activation wearing the One Ring, then their controlling player must test to see if the model can overcome the call of the Ring. To do this, the Ringbearer's controlling player rolls a D6 before doing anything else for the Ringbearer during their Activation. A Hero may use Might to improve this roll. On a 3+, the Ringbearer is able to keep control and may Activate as normal. However, on a 1-2 the opposing player may Move the Ringbearer during their Activation, and may even make them Charge – in this case, the model passes all Courage Tests for the Terror special rule. The opposing player cannot make the Ringbearer remove the Ring when they Move them.\nThe opposing player cannot make the Ringbearer pick up or put down items, perform anything that may bring the Ringbearer to harm (such as Jumping off a cliff or making a Leap Test), or make them leave the board in Scenarios that allow it.\nIt's important to note that even when an opposing player gets to Move the Ringbearer in this manner, they are still part of their controlling player's Army, and all other actions such as Shooting, fighting in Combat, or anything else the Ringbearer can do remains under the control of their controlling player.\nREMOVING THE RING\nSuch is the hold of the Ring, that any model who is wearing it and wants to remove it must take a Courage Test. This can be done at any point in the model's Activation, though after making the roll for Sauron's Will (if applicable). If the model fails this Courage Test then they cannot take the Ring off this turn and must wait until the following turn to try again.\nMY PRECIOUS!\nDuring a Matched Play game, if the Ringbearer is the only model left on their side and is Invisible (i.e., they are wearing the Ring), then they succumb to the call of the Ring and are removed as a casualty. If the opposing side's objective is to kill the Ringbearer, then this is still achieved if the Ringbearer is removed in this manner.\nThere may be the odd occasions in Matched Play games where there is more than one model on the battlefield who can carry the One Ring. As the One Ring is unique, there is a hierarchy as to who carries the One Ring in the case of multiple Ringbearers. The model closest to the top of the hierarchy table below will get to use the Ring – the other will not be a Ringbearer at all for that battle.\n1 The Dark Lord Sauron\n2 Isildur\n3 Bilbo Baggins or Bilbo Baggins, Master Burglar\n4 Frodo Baggins\n5 Bilbo Baggins, Ageing Hobbit\n6 Gollum\nIn the rare situation where both players have a Ringbearer, and both are at the same highest point on the hierarchy table, then both may carry the One Ring – though one of them is clearly a fake, and only the winner can claim that theirs was the real One Ring"

These cannot be deployed in the enemy's deployment zone, within 3\" of another Trap Marker or an Objective Marker, or within an enemy model's Control Zone. When an enemy model Moves within 1\" of a Trap Marker, they immediately stop Moving and flip the Trap Marker; after resolving its effects, the model's Activation immediately ends. Monster, War Beast, Swarm and Chariot models are completely unaffected by Trap Markers, and will instead simply remove them from play if they Move within 1\" of them. Once a Trap has been resolved and any affected models are no longer affected, remove that Trap Marker from play. The effects of each Trap Marker are explained below:\n        \n        • Tripwire Trap – When this is revealed, Baldo's player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap suffers a Strength 2 hit and is placed Prone. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\n        • Pitfall Trap – When this is revealed, Baldo's player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap falls into the hole. Whilst in a hole, a model may not Move and always counts as Trapped. If a model begins its Move in a hole, they must roll a D6; on a 4+, the model clambers out of the hole and their Move immediately ends. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\n        • Snare Trap – When this is revealed, Baldo's player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap suffers a Strength 1 hit, is placed Prone and is now caught in the Snare Trap. A model caught in a Snare Trap cannot Activate and will always count as Trapped. During the End Phase, a model caught in a Snare Trap must roll a D6; if the roll is equal to or less than their Strength, then they are freed from the Snare Trap. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\n        • Dummy Trap – When this is revealed, the Activation of the model that revealed the Trap Marker immediately ends.
